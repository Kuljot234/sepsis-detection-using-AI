🧠 Sepsis Detection Using AI

A machine-learning powered system to predict Sepsis early using patient clinical data.
This project aims to support healthcare professionals by providing an AI-based decision support tool that identifies high-risk patients with improved accuracy and faster detection.

🚀 Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition caused by an extreme immune response to infection. Early detection significantly improves survival chances.
This project uses AI/ML models to analyze patient vitals and lab results to determine the likelihood of sepsis onset.

🔍 Features

✔️ Preprocessing of clinical data
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Training ML/DL models for prediction
✔️ Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC curve)
✔️ Interactive frontend (Next.js / React)
✔️ REST API or full-stack integration for predictions
✔️ Clean and modular codebase
